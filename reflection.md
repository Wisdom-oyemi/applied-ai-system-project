# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

Basic responsibilities: add pets, schedule walk sessions, view daily tasks, track routines, etc.

**a. Initial design**

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
Owner is the most important class, because every other class derives from its functionality. The Owner can directly affect the Pet class (via manual manipulation) or through the Scheduler class, which performs actions on the Pet and Task classes automatically.

- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?
Classes: Owner, Pet, Scheduler, Task

Responsibilities: get assigned tasks/special needs (Pet); assign objective with time duration/priority (Task); add pet/task/schedule (Owner); generate and optimize schedules (Scheduler)

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
The design changes were minimal, but a few small things were added.

- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.
One change that was made was a better link between Pet and Task via implementing a tasks list (for the get_assigned_tasks function to have data to work with).

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

---

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?
